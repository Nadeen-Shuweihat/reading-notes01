## Process and Design 

* we need to understand who the target audience is , why they are visiting and what they want to find 

* To do that there are a couple of things to do such as 
    - site map (helps you to plan the structure of a site, helps in sorting the information, usually begin with the home page)

    - wirefram (like the sketch drawing in other words, helps you to set up your mind and organize your ideas in how you want the site to look like)

    - design (designing is everything, you catch the audience attention with how the site is shown and visualized )

    - gourping (helps you to organize the visual elements)
        - types of gouping :
             * proximity
             * clousre
             * continuance
             * white spaces
             * color
             * borders
        (matching elements have similar importance)

      

# Chapter 17
## HTML

* HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language 

* There are many examples of the elements that can be used to define different parts of a web page such as the semantic and non-sematic elements 

     - examples of the semantic elements :
        * header <header>
        * footer <footer>
        * navigation <nav?>
        * atricles <atricle>
        * aside  <aside>
        * sections <section>
        
     - example of non-semantic elements :
        * dividing <div>



# Chapter 7 
## Forms ( summrize it by mistake)

* to collect information from visitors 

* there are several types of forms such as :
    - adding text
    - choices
    - uploading files

* How does it work ?

    1- fill the form

    2- the name is sent to the server

    3- processing time 

    4- create a new page 


* form Structure :
    <form action - "url" mention -"get">


* user name and password structure :
    <form action="http://www.example.com/login.php">
<p>Username:
 <input type="text" name="username" size="15"
 maxlength="30" />
</p>
<p>Password:
 <input type="password" name="password" size="15"
 maxlength="30" />
</p>
</form>


* text area Structure :
    <form action="http://www.example.com/comments.php">
<p>What did you think of this gig?</p>
 <textarea name="comments" cols="20" rows="4">Enter
 your comments...</textarea>
</form>

And you can try creating many more things that are related to the forms such as checkbox, drop down list box, multiple select box, file input box, submit button , email , search box ...etc
