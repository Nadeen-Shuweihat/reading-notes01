# JAVASCRIPT BOOK pages (150-151, 156-157, 170-173, 176)

## 1-Functions 
(group set of related statements together that represent a single task)
(takes parameters and may return the value )

## 2-Object
(series of variables "properties" and functions "methods" )
- examples of javascript objects ( string, number, math, date)

## 3-Evaluating conditions and conditional statement

* ----> evaluating condition 
(checking the current status of the script , done by comparing two values and return the value of true or false)

* ----> conditional statement 
(based on the concept of if, then, else, if a condition is metting the code it will take action or more else your code does something different)

## 4-comparison operators: evaluating conditions
 
 * the result will be boolean 
 
 - == equal to (compare values)
 - != not equal to
 - === strict to (compare data type and value)
 - !=== not strict to 

## 5-IF else statement
 
 * allows you to provide 2 sets of code 

## 6-Switch statement

 * starts with switch value 
 * faster than the if else
 * entire statement lives in one code block 
 * each case ends with break (tells javascript to skip the rest of the code block)

## 7-logical operator 
 (symbol that is used when you want to compare 2 or more values)

 * && and 
 (when we have both values true it will result true)

* || or 
(if any of the value we have is true the result will be true)

* ! not 
(not true = false , not false = true ) for one condition 
               
### - loops (sets of instuctions to repeat a block of code until a specific condition is met)
we have 2 types of loops: 

  * 1- while loop 
----> while(condition){code}
  * 2- for loop
----> for(intialize;condition;update){code}
