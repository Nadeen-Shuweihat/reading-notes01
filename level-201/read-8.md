- use position to control the layout

- normal flow ( paragraphs appear one after the other, vertically down the page.)

- Positions :

- realative position (moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow,then use the offset properties)

- absolute position (taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the other elements)

- fixed position (type of absolute positioning that requires the position property to have a value of fixed)

- float (moves to the right or left of the page )

- Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch 

- Fixed width layout (don't change size as the user zoom in and out ,use pixels)
 
- liquid layout (stretch and contract as the user zoom in or out , use percentage)
