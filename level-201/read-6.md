## objects 

- used to create a model of something from real world

- in objects variables are properities (tell us about the object)

- in bobjects functions are methods (tasks that are aassociated with the object)

- properties and methods have a name and a value - keys

- key can't have two key with the same name 

- value of object can be anything but the methods are always functions

- literla notation - easiest way to create an object

- Accessing and updating the DOM tree involves two steps: 
    
    * : Locate the node that represents the element you want to work with

    * Use its text content, child elements, and attributes. 

- DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes,element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes. 

- we can select elemnts nodes by (id , class , name tags ,css selector)
 
- textContent (access and update an element)

- element node can contain multiple text nodes and child elements that are siblings of each other. 

- we can add or delete html content by using innerHtml property and don manipulation 

- looping
