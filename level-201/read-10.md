- it doesn't matter where your functions are if you are calling them in order (but stood still its better to have everything in order)

- js reads a line at a time that's why the order is important because of the functions and statement 
    (get their values from global scope or function scope)

- 2 stages to act the code 
       
       * prepare
       * execute

- error objects will contain :
 
       * name
       * message
       * file num
       * line num

- types of error

- to fix the error you should look where and what is the error and after that start fixing and trying 

- console.log will gives yiu exactly what and where is the error in your code 

- If you know that you may get an error, you can handle it gracefully using the try, catch, finally statements. 

- And finally the right way to solve an error after trying with your code for ages
