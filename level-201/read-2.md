## Introducing CSS - Chapter 10


- how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.
        - Selectors indicate which element the rule applies to
        - Declarations indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled

- CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon.
        - Properties indicate the aspects of the element you want to change
        - Values specify the settings you want to use for the chosen properties.


* adding css externaly by link the css page in the html page 
* adding css internaly by using the style tag 


## Basic javascript instructions - chapter 2 

Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon. 

- variables 
    (stored information)

   * how to declare them ?
      create a variable and give it a name 

   * how to assign them to a value ?
      by using the =

- data type :

   * string (anything between '')
   * numbers 
   * boolean (true , false)

- Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value. 

   * arithmetic operator 
       (- ,+ ,* ,/ , ++, -- ,%)

   * string operator
        (+)  concatenation. 

- Arrays 
    (are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.)

 
## Decisions and loops - chapter 4 

- there are 2 components to a decision:
    1- an expression is evaluated which runs a value
    2- a conditional statement says what to do 

* Comparison operators that the answer will be boolean 
   - == (compare values)
   - != not equal to
   - === (compare value and data type)
   - !== 
   - >
   - <
   - >=
   - <=

* Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators. 
    - && (and)
    - || (or)
    - !  (not)

* if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false
