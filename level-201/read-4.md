## links in html 

- created by < a >tag and the reference attributes (hrerf)

- we use it to link other pages or other websites

- relative path to link different pages and live url to other websites

- target attribute allow you to open the link in a new tab

- structure is important to know the paths



## Layout

- 2 kind of elements (inline - block)

- use position to control the layout

- normal flow ( paragraphs appear one after the other, vertically down the page.)

- realative position (moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow,then use the offset properties)

- absolute position (taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the other elements)

- fixed position (type of absolute positioning that requires the position property to have a value of fixed)

- float (moves to the right or left of the page )

- Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch 

- Fixed width layout (don't change size as the user zoom in and out ,use pixels)
 
- liquid layout (stretch and contract as the user zoom in or out , use percentage)

- Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide 

- You can include multiple CSS files in one page.


## functions 

- grouping a set of instructions that does something and can be used again by just calling the function without rewriting the code

- help us to not repeat ourself in coding 

- to create a function you need to give it a name and then write a statement then the code and after call it 

     function sayHey(){code};

     sayHello();

- declaring a function that needs an information by giving it parameters 

     function getArea(width,hieght){return width*height};

     getArea();

- calling a function that needs information by adding values in the calling brackets

   getArea(3,5);

- you can get a multiple values out of a function by using an array

- you have 2 kind of variable scopes 

    (globaly scope - variable created outside the function and can be used anywhere)

    (locally scope - variable created inside the function and will work only there )
