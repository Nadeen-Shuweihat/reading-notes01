in the past the web and pages took ages to load and the there weren't enough space for the data (it was limited to 4 kb for the cookies and the web stores up to 64 kb user data) 


but then the HTML5 storage was created which is simply "itâ€™s a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser."



- as a coder you will access HTML5 storage from you javascript code

- you store data based on key/value pair 

- "If you are storing and retrieving anything other than strings, you will need to use functions like parseInt() or parseFloat() to coerce your retrieved data into the expected JavaScript datatype."

- the limitations of the now-standardized HTML5 Storage ( 5 mb )
